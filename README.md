Random assortment of interesting projects.

Putting most projects on hold temporarily while I am currently focusing on a project to develop an effective model to predict the outcome of Congressional House elections, 1976-2020. Mainly just some exploratory models at first to see the impact of features to setup doing causal inference work later to establish what factors are most important (region, party affiliation, economic indicators, etc.). Right now am exploring using an RNN to perform character-level classification of candidate names to see if my model can find predictive power in the names of candidates themselves ( Barack Obama supposedly had concerns about running for office because he thought his name sounded too "odd"--but perhaps it sounded "strong" as well, and actually contributed to his win--I want to see if names have an impact on the race).
